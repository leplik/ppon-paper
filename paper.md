## Abstract
This paper proposes an innovative approach to machine translation of text into a universal pictogram language, designed to enhance accessibility in communication across various contexts. We introduce a structured pictogram-based language system **specifically designed to be compatible with neural machine translation (NMT) models**, enabling real-time generation and image synthesis. Our approach uses a compact representation with up to two modifiers per pictogram and simplified tense markers, **aiming to create a versatile bridge between any natural language and pictographic representation**. This system potentially revolutionizes accessible technology and communication methods for diverse user groups by **facilitating easy translation to and from any language**.

## 1. Introduction
Communication is a fundamental human right and a critical aspect of daily life. While traditional text-based communication serves many, there is a growing need for more accessible and intuitive forms of information exchange. This need extends beyond individuals with cognitive disabilities to include scenarios such as international communication, rapid information dissemination in emergencies, and enhancing human-computer interaction.

Pictograms offer a visual alternative that can be more universally accessible and intuitive. This research explores the development of a machine translation system that converts natural language text into a structured, universal pictogram-based language. **By leveraging recent advancements in neural machine translation and image generation technologies, we aim to create a system that can seamlessly translate between any language and our pictogram language, producing pictograms in real-time and adapting to various contexts and user needs.**

### 1.1 Accessible Technology and Universal Design
The proposed pictogram language system aligns with the principles of accessible technology and universal design. **By creating a visual language that can be easily translated to and from any spoken or written language, we aim to make information more accessible to a wider range of individuals**, including but not limited to:

- People with cognitive disabilities
- International travelers
- Emergency responders and victims in crisis situations
- Language learners
- Users of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices
